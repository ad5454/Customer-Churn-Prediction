****What is Customer Churn Prediction?****</br>
So, Churn Prediction is like predicting
which clients are most likely to cancel a
subscription i.e 'leave a company'
based on their usage of the service.

****But Why there is a need for that?****</br>
From a company's point of view, it is necessary for them
to gain this information because acquiring new customers
for their services is often arduous and costlier compare to
retaining the old ones. And that's why the insights they
gain from Customer Churn Prediction help them to focus
more on the current customers which are at a high risk of
leaving the company.
